# Hi, I'm Saleh

I am a final-year Electrical & Electronic Engineering student with a strong interest in both hardware and software design.  
My focus lies in embedded systems, IoT, and power electronics, with hands-on experience in STM32 microcontrollers, multi-layer PCB design, and industrial automation.  

I enjoy bridging hardware and software to create reliable, real-world systems. Beyond engineering, I have a deep passion for electronics as a whole and a strong personal interest in aviation.
